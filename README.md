JumpyRex
Interactive Graphics a.a. 17/18 Final Project
Marzio Persiani & Luca Torresi

For our Interactive Graphics project, we decided to implement a 3D version of Dino Runner, the 2D Google Chrome game which starts whenever the network is not available. This seemed a good example of a project in which we could put in practice the theory learned during the course. In fact, we had the possibility of implementing a hierarchical 3D model, animating it, decorating it with various textures, building a simple world in which events drive the interaction between different models and creating a series of user interfaces. To create our project from scratch, we chose to use Three.js library, on top of WebGL rendering engine. Three.js came very handy throughout all the phases of the project: we used it to create our models, animate and decorate them, creating a scene and adding a source of light to it and handling the interactions and collisions between the various models. For the user interface, we instead used HTML and CSS standard code. The game is fairly simple in its dynamics: the player controls Rex, a goofy Tyrannosaurus Rex made of polygons, and tries to run further as she/he can through the desert, avoiding cactuses and flying birds. When Rex hits one obstacle instead of jumping it, the game ends. To add a bit of personalization to the concept, the player can choose the color of Rex among green, orange, purple and blue.
